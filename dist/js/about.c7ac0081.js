My Interest in computers and machine learning began when I played a chess match with my father, who told me a story which changed the way I see computers. He told me that once upon a time, a robot could beat Garry Kasparov, who was the world chess champion at that time and one of the highly skilled players in chess in the history. That was a story that could be forgotten easily with the time, but for it was the ignite that will push me towards studying computer science and forming my live around the goal of specializing myself in Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. </div><img class="post-img" src="'+i+'" alt="Garry vs Deep-Blue" data-v-3d1f5da0><div class="post-layer" data-v-3d1f5da0></div></section><h2 data-v-3d1f5da0>Education</h2><section class="post-two" data-v-3d1f5da0><img class="post-img" src="'+d+'" alt="Jamal-Abdulnasser-School-logo" data-v-3d1f5da0><div class="text-area" data-v-3d1f5da0> I completed my high school at Jamal Abdulnasser High School (JAHS), which is a special high school for students with top scores across the country.
